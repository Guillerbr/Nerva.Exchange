|| Release Notes ||
-------------------

1) The Exchange backend is active and running. It should process all orders without any problem. 
Currently 2 network confirmations are required for Bitcoin deposits. The backend will process exchange
in 30 seconds after the second confirmation.

2) Maximum order is 12.5 USD for the first open-beta testing. This limit will be raised with upcoming
updates. The reason why I have such low limit is that I want people to test system, and see if it works
and in case of any bug & problem, I can avoid losing big amounts. (In case someone manages to steal 
bitcoins from website's bitcoin wallet. Such attack would not effect your transactions or deposited 
bitcoins, it would only make me lose money.)

3) The exchange rate is determined at the time when Bitcoin deposit gets second confirmation. I can not
control this rate. It is all determined by an algorithm and exchange is made automaticly. In case XNV 
price increases while your transaction is waiting for network confirmation, I can't do anything about it.
So, keep in mind that exchange will occur at the exact second when deposit gots second confirmation. 
Time your purchases accordingly.

4) We have 0.00003 BTC fixed fee for Bitcoin deposits, around 20 cents or 3 XNV, which enables the 
backend to process smaller orders. Normally, such coin-shifting websites has minimum order size around
5-6 USD but on Nerva.Exchange, this amount is 0.0001 BTC, around 60 cents. So, you can even put 1 USD 
and get corresponding XNV after deduction of fees and conversion. 

5) We also have 4% exchange fee, which directly goes to the Exchange's safe, as income. But I am aware 
that 4% fee is kinda high compared to exchanges. So, this rate will be lower on full release. However,
at the moment I will just test the system for a while and see if it is working as intended. You can
assume that 4% fee as donation for further development.

6) As you have seen on the mainpage, we do not require any information. We do not store your data.
Nerva.Exchange is completely anonym platform which you can use without any concerns. Also you can reach
the website from TOR network if you want. There is only one "tracking" or kinda third party code, which
is "re-captcha" for verifying the user is a human but not a computer script. At the moment I had to use
it to verify requests, but I will keep working on this problem and try to find a solution in order not
to store any data on third party websites.

7) At this release, I will keep trade data such as your XNV address, BTC address that you made deposit,
XNV exchange rate, how many XNV you have received, order creation date, BTC refund address of yours.
However, these datas will not include any IP address, or e-mail, or geographic location. I will keep
these informations just to see if there will be any error, or problem on the backend. When the website
becomes full version, these datas will be deleted regularly to provide anonimity to the users. But, even
at this point, I will not keep any data that might track/reveal your personal information.

8) Color scheme of the website is just a testing scheme made by me. I am not a professional designer, so
please share your ideas with me about design and what could be made better and how. Also this version
of the website only works well on desktop devices. Mobile devices or some small displays could experience
problems. I will work on this aswell but I just didn't want to delay the release so it is as it is at the 
moment. 

9) At the moment, the buttons & links are not working. I will work on them and update the buttons asap.
But I didn't want to delay the release only for some not-too-important buttons. So, there you have the
reason.

10) The price of Nerva on the mainpage updates every three seconds and it is there just to show estimated
price for possible transaction. It is not the exact price the backend uses. The rate you get could be 
slightly higher or lower.

|| Road Map ||
--------------

This is the roadmap for the upcoming two weeks. It could take more than two weeks for some features to 
be implemented because of personal reasons (university, family etc.). 

1) Release of Terms & Conditions

2) Updating the buttons and links on the website as well as adding the About Us, Fees and F.A.Q. content.

3) Logo and favicon design. (I will have to learn that as well)

4) Re-writing the backend exchange algorithm to make it more feasible with larger amounts. 

5) Fixing small design bugs. Adding transaction hash information if a transactions has been successfully
finished and XNV sent. (Currently system sends the XNV to given wallet but doesn't display the TX Hash)

6) Adding timestamps to exchange and transactions. (Optional, will ask some users if they'd want such thing)

7) Slightly increasing maximum order limit and decreasing minimum order limit.

8) Auto refresh & update feature on the order-status page. (Currently user needs to refresh page, enter
order ID on the main page again, and pass re-captcha verification).
