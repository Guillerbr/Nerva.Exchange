* Order calculation equations are re-written. Now the backend is able to
process big amount of buy requests such as +500 USD ones. (Still there is
order limit tho).

* Input fields on start-order page are now required fields to submit form.
This prevents starting new orders with no XNV or/and BTC address entered.
Also field data are now sent to the server in a different way to prevent
possible SQL injections. 

* Website now uses HTTPS SSL protocol and redirects all HTTP requests to
HTTPS. Users now can safely enter their wallet addresses.

* Added favicon

* Minimum order amount has changed due to some calculation errors made by me.
Now minimum order size is 0.00015 BTC (approximately 90-95 cents).

* Entering non-valid order ID and having a false info displaying order-status
page bug removed. Now if you enter a non-valid order ID, it displays the error
message accordingly.

* Refreshing on the order ID page redirecting to start-order page bug got
removed. Now it redirects to the main page. (This will change in near future
and refreshing will refresh the order status page and will display most
recent order data). 

* Version and release notes link has moved to the left side of main container
